Description: `gemino` efficiently (i) reads and simulates reference genomes;
    (ii) generates variants using summary statistics, phylogenies, Variant
    Call Format (VCF) files, and coalescent simulationsâ€”the latter of which can include
    selection, recombination, and demographic fluctuations;
    (iii) simulates sequencing error, mapping qualities, restriction-enzyme digestion, 
    and variance in coverage among sites; and
    (iv) writes outputs to standard file formats.
    `gemino` can simulate single or paired-ended reads for WGS on the Illumina platform,
    and can be extended to simulate different methods (e.g., original RADseq,
    double-digest RADseq, and genotyping-by-sequencing), and sequencing technologies
    (e.g., Pacific BioSciences, Oxford Nanopore Technologies).
