Description: `jackalope` simply and efficiently
    simulates (i) variants from reference genomes and (ii) reads from both Illumina
    and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platforms. 
    It can either read reference genomes from FASTA files or simulate new ones.
    Genomic variants can be simulated using summary statistics, phylogenies, 
    Variant Call Format (VCF) files, and coalescent simulationsâ€”the latter of which
    can include selection, recombination, and demographic fluctuations.
    `jackalope` can simulate single, paired-end, or mate-pair Illumina reads, 
    as well as reads from Pacific BioSciences.
    These simulations include sequencing errors, mapping qualities, multiplexing,
    and optical/PCR duplicates. All outputs can be written to standard file formats.
