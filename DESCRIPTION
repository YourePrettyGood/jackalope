Description: `jackalope` efficiently (i) reads and simulates reference genomes;
    (ii) generates variants using summary statistics, phylogenies, Variant
    Call Format (VCF) files, and coalescent simulationsâ€”the latter of which can include
    selection, recombination, and demographic fluctuations;
    (iii) simulates sequencing error, mapping qualities, and optical/PCR duplicates; and
    (iv) writes outputs to standard file formats.
    `jackalope` can simulate single, paired-end, or mate-pair Illumina reads, as well as
    reads from Pacific BioSciences.
