# gemino

**An efficient, flexible molecular evolution and sequencing simulator**

`gemino` efficiently (i) reads and simulates reference genomes; (ii)
generates variants using summary statistics, phylogenies, Variant Call
Format (VCF) files, and coalescent simulations—the latter of which can
include selection, recombination, and demographic fluctuations; (iii)
simulates sequencing error, mapping qualities, restriction-enzyme
digestion, and variance in coverage among sites; and (iv) writes outputs
to standard file formats. `gemino` can simulate single or paired-ended
reads for WGS on the Illumina platform, and can be extended to simulate
different methods (e.g., original RADseq, double-digest RADseq, and
genotyping-by-sequencing), and sequencing technologies (e.g., Pacific
BioSciences, Oxford Nanopore Technologies).
