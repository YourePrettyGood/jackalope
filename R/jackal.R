#' jackal: An efficient, flexible molecular evolution and sequencing simulator.
#'
#' `jackal` efficiently (i) reads and simulates reference genomes;
#' (ii) generates variants using summary statistics, phylogenies, Variant
#' Call Format (VCF) files, and coalescent simulationsâ€”the latter of which can include
#' selection, recombination, and demographic fluctuations;
#' (iii) simulates sequencing error, mapping qualities, and optical/PCR duplicates; and
#' (iv) writes outputs to standard file formats.
#' `jackal` can simulate single, paired-end, or mate-pair Illumina reads, as well as
#' reads from Pacific BioSciences.
