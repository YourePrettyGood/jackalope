\title{jackal: An efficient, flexible molecular evolution and sequencing simulator.}
\description{
\code{jackal} efficiently (i) reads and simulates reference genomes;
(ii) generates variants using summary statistics, phylogenies, Variant
Call Format (VCF) files, and coalescent simulationsâ€”the latter of which can include
selection, recombination, and demographic fluctuations;
(iii) simulates sequencing error, mapping qualities, restriction-enzyme digestion,
and variance in coverage among sites; and
(iv) writes outputs to standard file formats.
\code{jackal} can simulate single or paired-ended reads for WGS on the Illumina platform,
and can be extended to simulate different methods (e.g., original RADseq,
double-digest RADseq, and genotyping-by-sequencing), and sequencing technologies
(e.g., Pacific BioSciences, Oxford Nanopore Technologies).
